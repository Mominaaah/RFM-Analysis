# üõçÔ∏è Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis  

## Overview  
This project performs **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** on customer transaction data to identify different customer segments.  
The goal is to help businesses improve **customer retention, marketing strategies, and revenue growth** by targeting the right groups.  

### Dataset
This analysis uses the **Online Retail dataset**.  
You can download it from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail).

## Key Steps  
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. RFM Metric Calculation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)  
3. Customer Segmentation based on RFM scores  
4. Data Visualization & Insights  

## Insights  
- üìâ Most customers purchase **infrequently** and have low spending.  
- üíé A small group of **loyal/high-value customers** contribute the most revenue.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **At-risk customers** (high Recency, low Frequency) need re-engagement campaigns.  
- üéØ Businesses should **focus on Champions & Potential Loyalists** for best ROI.
